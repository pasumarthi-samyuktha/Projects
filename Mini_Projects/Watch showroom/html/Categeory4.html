<h2>MEN WATCHES</h2>
<p>A watch can tell a lot about a person, from their profession, hobbies and 
interests to personal style and fashion sense. Whether you are looking for a gift for someone special, 
or want to read into those around you a little more, you should always take note of the watch around 
a man's wrist.</p>

<h2>WOMEN WATCHES</h2>
<p>A woman's timepiece is often a slimmer rectangular or oval shape, 
whereas men's watches are mostly round. Lovely examples of this are the Venezia and Pistoia from 
the Italian timepiece collection. The premium quality, elegant, feminine diamond finish on these 
models draws the eye.</p>

<h2>CHILDREN WATCHES</h2>
<p>One of the core advantages is that, by owning a watch, children are 
encouraged to develop a sense of responsibility. They are responsible for taking care of their watch, 
and using it to keep track of time is an excellent way to introduce them to timekeeping and the 
importance of managing their time effectively.</p>
