 <blockquote><p>Traditionally, watches have displayed the time in analog form, with a numbered 
dial upon which are mounted at least a rotating hour hand and a longer, rotating minute hand. Many 
watches also incorporate a third hand that shows the current second of the current minute. In quartz 
watches this second hand typically snaps to the next marker every second. In mechanical watches, 
the second hand may appear to glide continuously, though in fact it merely moves in smaller steps, 
typically one-fifth to one-tenth of a second, corresponding to the beat (half period) of the balance 
wheel. With a duplex escapement, the hand advances every two beats (full period) of the balance 
wheel, typically 1⁄2-second; this happens every four beats (two periods, 1 second), with a double 
duplex escapement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Analog display of the time is nearly universal in watches sold as jewelry or 
collectibles, and in these watches, the range of different styles of hands, numbers, and other aspects 
of the analog dial is very broad. In watches sold for timekeeping, analog display remains very 
popular, as many people find it easier to read than digital display; but in timekeeping watches the 
emphasis is on clarity and accurate reading of the time under all conditions (clearly marked digits, 
easily visible hands, large watch faces, etc.).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The first digital electronic watch, a Pulsar LED prototype in 1970, was developed 
jointly by Hamilton Watch Company and Electro-Data, founded by George H. Thiess.[88] John 
Bergey, the head of Hamilton's Pulsar division, said that he was inspired to make a digital timepiece 
by the then-futuristic digital clock that Hamilton themselves made for the 1968 science fiction film 
2001: A Space Odyssey. On 4 April 1972, the Pulsar was finally ready, made in an 18-carat gold 
case and sold for $2,100. It had a red light-emitting diode (LED) display.</p>
